	A plugin that allows users to use Skutum web application firewall that identifies each and every request and traffic source on your website, without data sampling, allowing you to detect any malicious activity.

== Description ==
Skutum is an automated website monitoring tool that analyzes a website’s traffic sources in real time. Crawlers, bad bots, and scrapers hit your WordPress site every day causing the excessive usage of the server resources, extensive traffic consumption, and content scraping. Threat actors search for all types of vulnerabilities to crash or compromise your server and get access to your WordPress dashboard, databases, and servers. Skutum is made to help you detect all of these threats by inspecting your traffic thanks to a series of unique algorithms and а neural network system.

**Key Features:**

* Skutum is powered by the web application firewall that identifies each and every request and traffic source on your website, without data sampling, allowing you to detect any malicious activity.

* The plugin doesn’t affect your website performance and doesn’t overload your server since it works independently.

* It blocks neither human website visitors nor SEO bots (search engines that index your website content and affect your SEO ranking).

* Skutum protects your website from brute force attacks.

* The plugin doesn’t override .htaccess or robots.txt files as well as doesn’t force you to make any changes to them.

The current plugin version allows you to perform deep traffic analysis and get detailed statistics on traffic and request types dividing them into three categories: humans, SEO bots and bad bots.

**You’ll be able to access all this data in the WordPress plugin:**

* The number of requests per month, week, or the recent 24-hour period;

* Request type: humans, SEO bots or bad bots, plus the number of requests per each type;

* Extra statistics on the bad bots: IP addresses, countries that send the biggest number of requests.

At the moment the plugin doesn’t block malicious activity and bad bots; it works as a diagnostic and traffic analysis tool that provides you with sufficient statistics.
	
The future plugin releases will include the ability to turn on the bad bot blocking system and optionally tune advanced settings to meet your needs.
